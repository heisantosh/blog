Hi, I'm Santosh Heigrujam.

I'm a software engineer by profession. In my job I spend most of time plumbing APIs. At other times and weekends, I spend my time exploring open source software, linux and containers. I'm interested in space exploration, computing history, the hardware software interface and football âš½.

I like listening to podcasts. Some of my favorites include Revisionist History, Software Engineering Daily, Go Time, On the Metal, Linux Unplugged and Ghibliotheque.
