My name is **Santosh Heigrujam**.

I am a software engineer with a deep passion for understanding how things work under the hood. My professional journey revolves around designing and building robust software systems. I find joy in the details—whether it's optimizing a database query, designing a clean API, or debugging a race condition.

This space serves as a collection of my experiences and thoughts. Here, I write about:

*   **Software Engineering Systems:** Architecting scalable solutions and the trade-offs involved in system design.
*   **Engineering Practices:** The tools, workflows, and philosophies that make development effective and enjoyable.
*   **Experiences:** Lessons learned from the trenches of building and maintaining production software.

I believe in continuous learning and the value of sharing knowledge. I hope you find something useful here.
